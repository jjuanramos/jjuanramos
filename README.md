Hi there!

Glad you found my profile üòÑ my name is Juan, and I am an analytics-engineer-working-towards-a-more-technical-role kind of guy.

I left my work at Ebury on January 2024, and since then I have been focused on [42 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/en/), an innovative system where you get to learn about software engineering fundamentals by building projects in C and C++, such an example would be [minishell](https://github.com/cmunoz-g/minishell), a mini recreation of bash, or [cub3d](https://github.com/jjuanramos/cub3d), an implementation of the raycasting technique.

I have also built other software systems, such as [dbt-bigquery-preview](https://github.com/jjuanramos/dbt-bigquery-preview), a Visual Studio Code extension that improved the dbt's Developer Experience, with over 1.5k downloads.

I love writing too! I've got a personal substack, [Part√≠cipes](https://participes.substack.com/), where I publish essays and pieces of fiction. I gave a shot at technical writing once, and [shared an article](https://towardsanalyticsengineering.substack.com/p/how-to-configure-dbt-projects-in) that showed how we could replicate dbt's recommended structure in BigQuery. I think it turned out OK, and it's been viewed over 3k times at the time of writing.

Beyond that, I'm really into lifting weights üèãÔ∏è and calisthenics (currently working on my handstand), meditation üê≤, tech that feels nice ([this](https://daylightcomputer.com/) would be such an example), reading, writing, and live music.

I'm currently looking for a job! My main requirements are:
* hybrid / on-site. I believe there's so much tacit knowledge that is hard to learn fully remote. Also, I like people.
* I'd help building the data infrastructure of the company. I want to make decision making easier, and better!
* The product seems interesting, and solves a problem.
* Senior people I can learn from!

Everything else is optional, so if you've got something that fits those requirements, please reach out üòÉ

See you!
